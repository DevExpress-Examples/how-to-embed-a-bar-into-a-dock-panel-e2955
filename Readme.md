# How to embed a bar into a dock panel


<p>This example shows how to embed a bar from the DXBars library into a dock panel. </p><p>Dock panels embed bar containers at their top edges, allowing bars to be displayed in these containers. To add a bar to a dock panel's bar container, the name of the target bar container is assigned to the Bar.DockInfo.ContainerName property. This name matches the name of the LayoutPanel.HeaderBarContainerControlName property's value.</p><p></p>
